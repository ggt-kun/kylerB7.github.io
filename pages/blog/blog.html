		  		Wiki Loves Monuments (WLM) is a public photo competition around cultural heritage monuments, organised by Wikimedia chapters, groups and local Wikipedia volunteers. The public takes photos of monuments, upload those to Wikimedia Commons, and then they can be used in Wikipedia and its sister projects. The goal is to make the world’s  monuments visible and freely accessible to the world.
				This year Ghana joins the world to organize the contest that seeks to preserve Cultural Heritage through pictures, which is an important part of the knowledge Wikipedia collects and disseminates. It will be organized in Ghana by members of the Wikimedian Community in Ghana, in conjunction with The Ghana Museums and Monuments Board and Open Foundation West Africa a non-profit organisation  which aims at promoting the activities of Open Movements in Ghana and West Africa at large. This is a month-long activity and will take place from the  1st of September to the 30th September 2016.
				Everybody can contribute images as well as write articles. An image is worth a thousand words and this is universal irrespective of where you are geo-located. This is an opportunity for indigenes, local enthusiasts, tourists, etc. to (re)discover the cultural, historical, or scientific significance of these monuments in their communities or country. During this period pictures will be uploaded to the contest here, there are also planned activities  aimed at promoting and increasing images of Ghanaian monuments on Wikipedia via Wikimedia Commons, the online photo, video and audio repository for Wikipedia. These will include photowalks to some notable monuments in Ghana by volunteers comprising the Wikimedia Community in Ghana, Photowalk Ghana, Google  Local Guides Ghana and any one from the general public who may be interested. There will also be an upload session for upload of images and an edit-a-thon to create and improve Wikipedia articles around these monuments.
